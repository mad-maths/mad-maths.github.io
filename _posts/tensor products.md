Throughout texts I have read, the symbol $\oplus$ has popped up everywhere and my first real encounter with the 'Tensor Product' 
happened when I was dipping my toes into Representation Theory. In my efforts to understand this new mystical object, I scoured the internet 
and quickly realised that there are a bunch of definitions and interpretations of this vector space. 

This and upcoming blog posts is my attempt at understanding the different approaches and then concluding that they are not so different after all.
